# arq-helpers #

These scripts streamline (or, arguably, complicate) using [Arq][1] on
macOS. (The plural is aspirational, as there's currently only one. Maybe
there will be more later!) Some of them might be made to work on Windows
via [Cygwin][2] or an act of [Aslan][3], but I have neither the means nor
the inclination nor a [wardrobe][4].

To install, place them in an arbitrary location readable by any user who
wants to use them. I use `/usr/local/bin` like a schmuck, but feel free
to get creative.
